<h1>ABOUT US</h1>
<div class="container">
<!-- <img src="images/about_owner.png"> -->
<p>Mike Forster opened Bonjour in Wisconsin in 2010. He worked for the startup money by making lunches and dinners in his dorm during his tenure at USC. Charging $5 a plate. He did this all while getting a degree in Journalism. He saved every dime and put in a savings account where it accrued interest while it sat. After graduation he briefly worked for his local town's newspaper turned digital agency but his true calling was cooking. With the help of his money from college and another loan from his grandmother he was able to buy his first building which only held maybe 20 people at a time. Eventually his restaurant became so popular and garnered some local acclaim he was able to save yet again to buy an even bigger building and service even more customers. Bonjour was born and still remains the best restaurant in the Midwest. Bonjour is known for its melt like butter steaks, fresh veggies, great customer service, and a good time!</p>
